# CLAUDE.md — shared project memory

Project context for Claude Code sessions. This file is committed so every
machine and user working on Sussurro shares the same context — **record
project decisions here, not in per-machine memory.**

## Project layout

- `sussurro/` — the Tauri 2 app (React + TypeScript frontend, Rust backend
  in `sussurro/src-tauri/`). The repo root only holds docs and CI.
- Build instructions per OS live in `docs/compile/{windows,macos,linux}.md`
  — keep them updated when build requirements change.
- The About dialog's third-party license list is `sussurro/public/licenses.json`,
  generated from the resolved deps (cargo + npm). **Regenerate after changing
  dependencies:** `cd sussurro && npm run licenses` (needs the Rust toolchain;
  not run in CI to keep the pipeline simple — the file is committed).

## Standing decisions

- **Repo stays private until every platform builds and works.** Because of
  this, the Tauri auto-updater gets 404 on `latest.json` (anonymous access).
- **Auto-update is frozen until v0.5.0** (decided 2026-07-03): the signing
  pipeline keeps running on every release, but the repo/releases go public
  — and the updater becomes functional — only with 0.5.0. Don't propose
  making the repo public before that.
- **The v0.2.0 draft release is kept intentionally** — do not delete it.
- **License: AGPL-3.0-or-later** (chosen 2026-07-06). Copyleft that also covers
  network use (Sussurro exposes a local HTTP API), so no one can build a
  closed/proprietary product on it. Verified compatible with the whole dep tree
  (all permissive + MPL-2.0 + two GPL-3.0-or-later crates; no GPL-2.0-only or
  proprietary). `LICENSE` holds the verbatim text; SPDX `AGPL-3.0-or-later` is
  set in `package.json` + `Cargo.toml`. Copyright is retained by the author
  (Francesco Fullone / DarumaHQ) so a **commercial/dual license** can be sold
  later — don't relicense or add a CLA-less outside contribution that would
  fragment that. A permissive license (MIT) is NOT an option here: the
  GPL-3.0-or-later deps require a copyleft-compatible license.
- **macOS is Apple Silicon only (min 11.0)**: `ort` (ONNX Runtime) has no
  prebuilt binaries for `x86_64-apple-darwin`. Don't re-add the Intel
  target to the release matrix.
- Workflow: **branch → PR → merge** — no direct pushes to `main`.

## Release process

- Push a `v*` tag (from any branch) to trigger `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  → draft release with signed installers + `latest.json`. Publish by
  un-drafting.
- Never force-move an existing release tag; bump the patch version instead
  (version lives in `sussurro/package.json`, `sussurro/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`,
  `sussurro/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` + `Cargo.lock`).
- Updater signing key: outside the repo, uploaded as
  `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` secret (see README → Releases & auto-update).
  Changing the key pair orphans existing installs.
- **Manual release while Actions is down** (billing outage, ~until 2026-08):
  Windows is built/signed on the dev box, Linux in WSL, then
  `gh release create` with the assets + a hand-written `latest.json`.
  macOS assets are added from a Mac afterwards:
  ```bash
  git clone <repo> && cd Sussurro/sussurro && git checkout vX.Y.Z
  npm ci && npm run tauri build          # Apple Silicon
  node_modules/.bin/tauri signer sign \
    --private-key-path <sussurro-updater.key> --password "" \
    src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/sussurro.app.tar.gz
  gh release upload vX.Y.Z src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/sussurro.app.tar.gz* \
    src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/*.dmg
  ```
  then add the `darwin-aarch64` entry (URL + signature) to the release's
  `latest.json`. Beware: PowerShell drops empty `""` args and unsets
  empty env vars — sign via `cmd /c` on Windows (see scripts/ for helpers).

## CI gotchas (learned the hard way)

- **cdn.pyke.io (ort's prebuilt download) persistently 403s GitHub runners.**
  The test job links Microsoft's official ONNX Runtime release instead
  (`ORT_LIB_LOCATION` + `ORT_PREFER_DYNAMIC_LINK`); the release workflow
  still uses pyke's static binaries with an `ORT_CACHE_DIR` cache. If a
  release job fails with a 403 from cdn.pyke.io, re-run it; if it keeps
  failing, apply the MS-release fallback there too.
- Keep the pinned ONNX Runtime version in `test.yml` in sync with what the
  locked `ort-sys` expects (see the `ms@<version>` URLs in its
  `build/download/dist.txt`).
- Linux needs **glibc ≥ 2.38** (ubuntu-24.04 runners) — older glibc fails
  linking with `undefined symbol: __isoc23_strtoll`.
- macOS needs `minimumSystemVersion` ≥ 10.15 (whisper.cpp uses
  `std::filesystem`); it is set to 11.0 (arm64 baseline) in
  `tauri.conf.json`.
- **Actions minutes can run out** (private repo; macOS jobs bill 10x, Windows
  2x — one 3-OS release run burns ~200 min-equivalents). Symptom: every job
  fails in ~3 s with no steps and the annotation "job was not started …
  spending limit". Fix: Billing & plans on the owner account. Meanwhile
  `scripts/ci-local.sh` mirrors test.yml inside WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04
  (`wsl -d Ubuntu -u root -- bash /mnt/f/GitHub/Sussurro/scripts/ci-local.sh
  <branch>`) — it validated PR #53 end-to-end (tests, clippy, E2E smoke).
  Releases still need GitHub runners (macOS/Windows can't be mirrored).

## Roadmap (agreed 2026-07-03, current version 0.2.1)

### 0.3.0 — working everywhere (gate: every platform compiled AND verified)

1. Runtime smoke test on real Windows with the CI-built installer (msi/exe):
   hotkey → recording → Vulkan GPU transcription → paste injection.
2. Runtime smoke test on real Linux (AppImage/deb on Ubuntu 24.04).
3. **Native Wayland injection** — the biggest functional gap: modern distros
   default to Wayland and injection there is fragile. Status: wtype/ydotool
   ladder shipped; the RemoteDesktop portal (ashpd, issue #40) **shipped as
   the primary backend in 0.3.9** behind the default-on `wayland-portal`
   feature. Issue #40 stays open until the reporter verifies at runtime on
   KDE Plasma 6 Wayland.

### 0.4.0 — quality & tech debt

4. Streaming typing with cleanup enabled — **done & verified** (sentence-by-
   sentence streaming with per-chunk LLM cleanup landed with the Wispr-parity
   batch; manually verified by dictation on Windows 0.3.9-3 on 2026-07-05,
   "experimental" label removed).
5. Unpin cpal 0.16 → 0.18 (retest the windows-core conflict with Tauri).
   *Rechecked 2026-07-05: crates.io max is still 0.18.1, the broken one.
   Re-try when cpal releases a version on windows-core ≥ 0.62.*
6. Move `ort` from 2.0.0-rc.12 to stable when released (coordinate with the
   pinned ONNX Runtime version in test.yml — see CI gotchas).
   *Rechecked 2026-07-05: still no stable (max = 2.0.0-rc.12);
   transcribe-rs 0.3.11 is also the latest.*
7. Optional Vulkan GPU build on Linux (feature flag; CPU-only today).
   *Validated in WSL 2026-07-05: `--features linux-vulkan` compiles, all 86
   tests pass, and with no usable Vulkan device ggml falls back to CPU
   cleanly (no crash) — ggml ignores CPU-type devices like llvmpipe, so WSL
   can't exercise the GPU-on path. Remaining before shipping it in releases:
   one run on real Linux hardware with a proper Vulkan driver (correctness +
   perf), then decide whether it becomes a separate release artifact or the
   default. Build recipe documented in docs/compile/linux.md.*
8. Minimal E2E smoke test in CI — **done** (test.yml runs the app under Xvfb
   and asserts the window exists; mirrored in scripts/ci-local.sh).

### 0.5.0 — go public

9. macOS Developer ID signing + notarization (ad-hoc today → Gatekeeper
   blocks public users). Consider Windows code signing for SmartScreen.
10. Make the repo public → auto-update unfreezes (see standing decisions).
11. **Flatpak** (deferred here from 0.3.10 on 2026-07-03): distribution-only,
    no app changes. A ready manifest + release-workflow job live on the
    closed PR #46 / branch `feat/flatpak` — reuse them, then submit to
    Flathub (needs the public repo). AppImage already ships in every release
    (it's the updater's Linux format) — nothing to add there.

### 0.6.0 — candidate (not committed)

12. **Backend-agnostic cleanup client via the OpenAI-compatible API**
    (noted 2026-07-06). Today `cleanup/ollama.rs` talks Ollama's native
    schema (`/api/chat`, `/api/tags`). Switching to the de-facto standard
    `/v1/chat/completions` (+ a configurable base URL/model) would let any
    local runtime drive cleanup — Ollama (it also exposes `/v1`),
    llama.cpp-server, LM Studio, and frontier engines like antirez's **DS4**
    (DeepSeek V4, OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible) — with no per-backend code.
    Prompted by evaluating DS4 as an Ollama replacement: rejected as a
    *replacement* (single 284B model, 96–128 GB RAM, no Windows — wrong tool
    for a 2–3B cleanup job on consumer hardware), but it flagged that our
    Ollama-specific coupling is the real limitation. Keep Ollama the default;
    this is additive. `/api/tags` model discovery has no `/v1` equivalent, so
    the model picker would fall back to manual entry for non-Ollama backends.

## Per-machine setup

- **Windows dev machines must set a short `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`**
  (e.g. `setx CARGO_TARGET_DIR "C:\sbuild"`): whisper.cpp's Vulkan shader
  sub-build exceeds MAX_PATH otherwise (MSBuild FTK1011). Full details in
  `docs/compile/windows.md`.
- **Never commit a `.cargo/config.toml` with `target-dir`**: a drive-letter
  path is relative on Linux/macOS and its `:` breaks `cargo test`
  (`failed to join paths from $LD_LIBRARY_PATH`). One was removed from the
  repo for exactly this reason.
